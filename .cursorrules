# Instructions

During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `scratchpad.md` file at the root directory so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `scratchpad.md` file at the root directory as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2
Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Docs
For latest package docs like langgraph API to refer to before using its own intelligence

# Tools

Note all the tools are in python. So in the case you need to do batch processing, you can always consult the python files and write your own script.

## LLM

You always have an LLM at your side to help you with the task. For simple tasks, you could invoke the LLM by running the following command:
```
../py3/Scripts/python ./tools/llm_api.py --prompt "What is the capital of France?"
```

But usually it's a better idea to check the content of the file and use the APIs in the `tools/llm_api.py` file to invoke the LLM if needed.

## Web browser

You could use the `tools/web_scraper.py` file to scrape the web.
```
../py3/Scripts/python ./tools/web_scraper.py --max-concurrent 3 URL1 URL2 URL3
```
This will output the content of the web pages.

## Search engine

You could use the `tools/search_engine.py` file to search the web.
```
../py3/Scripts/python ./tools/search_engine.py "your search keywords"
```
This will output the search results in the following format:
```
URL: https://example.com
Title: This is the title of the search result
Snippet: This is a snippet of the search result
```

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ../py3.
- Use relative paths in the code.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Use LLM to perform flexible text understanding tasks. First test on a few files. After success, make it parallel.
- By default, assume this is under Windows, so use Windows PowerShell not Unix/Linux command.
- Do not include unicode characters.


## Code Style and Structure

- Use docstrings to explain the code.
- Use a single file for a single task.
- Do not use unicode character use reuglar ASCII character
- The file structure is as follows:
```
├── data/           # Input data files
├── output/         # Output files for analysis results including csv files, plots, etc.
├── src/            # Source code files and scripts for different projects
├── tools/          # Tool files
├── docs/           # Latest package docs files

```
